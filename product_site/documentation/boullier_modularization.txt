1. Currently, no code can be modularized :(. I already took care of this last assignment..

2. :(

3. This assignment, I will focus on making more modular code.

The part of the site I will be focusing on is the genre pages. Each genre image will direct you to a different page with lots of that genre on it.
I will be making one of the pages (Action); i will create a singular Action.js script that will decide what content to show depending on the header at the top of the page.

I will have a function called getMediaType with no inputs. It's output will be an array of media (movies, games, or shows).

I will have another function called showMedia() which will take an array that is the content to show.
