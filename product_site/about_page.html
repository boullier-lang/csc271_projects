			&emsp; <strong>In the modern age,</strong> there are tons of different ways to see the reviews for any type of media: IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Steam, YouTube. 
			Yet, many times, how the fans feel and how the professional critics feel are completely different. In even more cases, critics and influencers
			are often paid or sponsored by the company that made the product. Their reviews are flashy, polished, but ultiamtely, shallow, and devoid of
			anything that feels like someone passionate about the media was ever really there. Not only that, but review bombing has become an 
			increasingly popular way to protest a company. While it is understandable, it can make it hard for people to truly gauge whether a game, movie,
			or TV show is good, or if people are just upset.<br>

			&emsp; <strong>That is where we are different.</strong> Every review is written by a gamer, a movie lover, a fan of a show. Somebody that knows the ins and outs,
			and knows them well. Our perspective based system also allows for you to read how casual fans, hardcore fans, and people completely new to the 
			content feel about something. These reviewers will be selected carefully, meaning that review-bombing will not be possible.
			<br> 
			&emsp;<strong> However, we also know </strong> that discussion is important. That is why we also have dedicated discussion areas for each
			piece of media. It allows people to express their ideas, frusturations, and agree or disagree with given reviews. Our goal is to provide a place
			for fans to finally be able to trust the reviews that they read.

			&emsp;<strong>Becoming a reviewer</strong> is very simple! We encourage people to apply to review content, both new and old. However, it is emphasized that <em> there are certain expectations </em> for reviewers!
			Not everyone can become one, and those who are reviewers must act accordingly. Specifically,
			
			<ol>
				<li> No hate speech for any reviews. An actor or director's race, religion, or ideology should not impact any of your reviews.
					<ul>
						<li> Critiquing an actor's abilities, performance, or otherwise is perfectly fine. </li>
						<li> Discussing a hatred for a character inside the media is also perfectly fine. </li>
						<li> Any hatred directed towards the actor, or director themselves are not permitted for reviews. Keep them to discussion posts. </li>		
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Do not insult other TrueTake reviwers in your reviews. Other reviews should not have an impact on any of your reviews.
					<ul>
						<li> Critiquing larger critic reviewers (such as IMDB) is fine. </li>
						<li> Referencing other TrueTake reviews is fine; however, insulting their takes is strictly prohibited. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li> 
					Keep your reviews clear.
					
					<ul>
						<li> Your reviews can have jokes, and even a silly tone. </li>
						<li> Your reviews should be clear in why you ranked something the way you did. One worded reviews, nonsencial or incoherent reviews are prohibited. </li>
					
					</ul>
				</li>
			
			</ol>
			
			<br>
			
			Breaking these rules will result in your Reviewer status being removed.
